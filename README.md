## Usage

This repository can be used to create a codespace,
by using it as a template for new projects, or
including it as a submodule in an existing project.

To import as a submodule use 'git submodule add'

    git submodule add https://github.com/raymond-chetty/codespaces-AndroidSDK-CE .devcontainer

In theory it is possible to add access to additional
repositories within a codespace using 'customizations'
